                    <p>At the turn of the new year the hashtag #BoringHaskell sparked a debate in the functional programming Twitterverse, drawing into question the overuse of advanced FP techniques at work and how it deters newcomers from the functional paradigm. The Scala community joined in on this discussion, bringing forth its own closet of skeletons and posing some existential questions to itself:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Does functional programming in Scala need a rebrand?</li>
                      <li>Have we gone too far with types and freaky language features?</li>
                      <li>Should we simplify our code for the sake of junior developers?</li>
                      <li>What does simple even mean?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In this talk, we aim to settle the debate for Scala programmers based on a hard truth to swallow – functional programming is already simple, but we’ve been implementing it in an unfriendly way.</p>
                    <p>First, we look to accurately define what simplicity means in the context of programming. We then introduce a decision framework for Simple Functional Programming centered around three tenets: Composability, Caution and Cleanliness. With these principles in mind, we dive into real world code examples demonstrating effective and confusing deployments of FP. Along the way, we highlight common antipatterns such as completion chasing, type Tetris, and the dreaded Hammer Syndrome.</p>
                    <p>The intended audience for this talk includes programmers of all levels. Advanced practitioners will walk away with new strategies for writing approachable code, and less experienced developers will gain new confidence in utilizing functional patterns and libraries. Familiarity with Scala, its syntax and some familiarity with functional programming concepts are assumed, but not required.</p>

This talk introduces AI / deep learning from scratch and guides you through an unique image classification use case, for which both dataset and code are provided. At the end of this talk, you will have a basic understanding of the mechanics behind deep learning and a solid starting point for your own experiments.</p>
                    <p>There is a live demo too! We will build a neural network using Scala and <a href="https://deeplearning4j.org/">deeplearning4j</a>, train it and then run it on a Raspberry PI to classify images taken with its camera. The goal is to detect reliably if the image contains a plane or not. When so, the picture is tweeted at <a href="https://twitter.com/PlanesOnBridge">@PlanesOnBridge</a>. Akka Streams is the engine that ties it all together.</p>

                    <p>As Developers, we spend countless hours in our editors writing and reading code. Good navigation, refactoring, and features like code completions, signature information, and find references are essential. This used to mean that you had limited options that were dependent on the language you were programming in. However, enter LSP, the Language Server Protocol, and this is no longer the case. In this talk we’ll dive into defining and understanding LSP by looking at Metals, the Scala Language Server, and how it allows you to use your favorite editor (as long as it supports LSP) with Scala. Along the way, we’ll also explore things like Bloop, BSP, and SemanticDB that allow this all to work together providing you with a fast, accurate, and editor-agnostic Scala development experience.</p>

                    <h2>Domain Specific means Business Logic</h2>
                    <p>In this talk I will make the case for small declarative languages embedded in Scala. We have found the eDSL design pattern can accelerate the writing of business logic while enforcing correctness properties via the Scala typesystem. I will show three examples of eDSLs that solve three different business problems.</p>
                    <h3>An eDSL for time-series analytics</h3>
                    <p>I will demonstrate an eDSL for elementary statistics and analytics on time-series data. In finance, we often work with periodic arrays of doubles that represent the monthly GDP of a country, quarterly sales margins of a company and more. In order to analyze time-series, some statistics such as arithmetic means, interpolations and Z-scores are necessary. There are plenty of pitfalls where new users can make mistakes, for example taking the standard deviation of an interpolated series will yield a lower volatility that doesn’t correspond to reality. Our eDSL uses Scala types to prohibit incorrect transformations, making the barrier to entry lower and the writing of valuable analytics logic faster.</p>
                    <h3>An eDSL for lazily computing on large dataframes</h3>
                    <p>Low-level control over timeseries is great, but sometimes we would like more high-level control via dataframes, similar to Pandas or Apache Spark. We would also like these dataframes to maintain the provenance of operations so we can reason about them in a backwards way and find errors. The final eDSL we will show reifies computation via Higher-Order Abstract Syntax (HOAS) and maintains the full provenance without maintaining the results of every intermediate computation step, which can be very expensive.</p>
                    <h3>An eDSL for formatting financial reports</h3>
                    <p>After generating good financial analytics, we would like to present them in a good looking report. Thankfully, there exist low-level APIs that allow plotting and charting data. Unfortunately, the low-level details such as fonts, colors and axes are intermingled with high-level control over data dimensionality and ordering. We will demonstrate a high-level eDSL that allows one to only care about data and layouting, pushing back formatting to the end, while allowing transparent, compositional access to data throughout the process.</p>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>There are several approaches to writing embedded DSLs, I would summarize my approach as avoiding unnecessary boilerplate, keeping the category theory knowledge needed at a strict minimum, while leveraging the Scala typesystem and Generalized Algebraic Datatypes (GADTs) as much as possible, to enforce correctness. This approach is motivated by my academic explorations in Formal Verification, where the eDSL semantics must perfectly reflect the language designer’s intention. My goal is to make a convincing case that eDSLs are an effective way to explore the domain of a business problem, while the usage of Scala as the host language is very encouraging, as it allows multiple eDSLs to compose nicely and run on the JVM.</p>

We will also explore the social issues involved when evangelizing new tech, and why sometimes we can run into fallacious roadblocks where invented complexity prevents us from actually doing the simplest thing.

                    <p>One of the reasons why we chose Scala at Foursquare is for its expressive type system. We can use the type system to eliminate large classes of bugs at compile time. We have specifically used phantom types with implicit functions to create type safe builders for 3 separate use-cases: setting up API servers, constructing mongo queries, and defining translatable user-facing strings.</p>
                    <p>In this talk, you will learn what phantom types are and how you can combine them with implicits. You will learn how to employ them in increasingly complex ways, solving real-world examples along the way.</p>

                    <p>Modern systems are usually designed as a collection of cooperating micro-services. These services commonly have their dedicated data stores for their individual needs. To support various requirements corresponding data are often stored in data stores with very different characteristics and use cases. A fundamental requirement emerging from these architectures is the need to reliably capture primary data changes. Change Data Capture (CDC) is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track the data that has changed so that action can be taken using the changed data. In this talk, I’d like to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various CDC approaches, provide you guidance in this area and also share our experience (~ ESPN+ and Disney+) including various samples (~ scala + sbt), and recommendations.</p>

                    <p>Binary compatibility in Scala is complex, and it is very easy for an application to depend on multiple libraries whose transitive dependencies conflict: where library A and library B pull in different versions of lower-level library C.  This results in “eviction” of the older version, and a compiler warning that is all-too-often just ignored as a minor inconvenience.  Which seems fine – until your service crashes at runtime.</p>
                    <p>Rally Health has a large and mature Scala ecosystem, involving hundreds of different services and shared libraries, scattered across many hundreds of repos.  This means that those version incompatibilities can easily cause crises: changes that look completely innocuous at each level individually can cause production crashes when all the pieces are put together.</p>
                    <p>As a result, we’ve adopted a variety of third-party libraries, and developed some of our own, that together result in a rigorous discipline for automatically avoiding these problems.  We enforce “shading” – the use of different class paths for different versions of a library – so that multiple versions of a library can coexist in the same application at the same time without difficulty.</p>
                    <p>This talk will also discuss one of the worst problem cases we have dealt with: Play itself, and specifically the play-json library, which is seductively easy to use everywhere but which turned out to cause major upgrade problems for the company.  As a result, we’ve wound up building a new hard-shaded JSON library, adopting the best ideas from many other libraries and following these shading practices, so that it can be safely used in enterprise software without risking runtime version collisions.</p>

                    <p>Finite state machines are a core concept in Computer Science, but are less common outside the classroom. It’s time to change that! In this talk I’ll show how finite state machines can solve a wide range of practical programming problems, focusing on web services and data engineering, while also being really use to implement and use.</p>
                    <p>Finite state machines provide a model for computation that hits the sweet spot for a great number of practical tasks: simple enough to easily understand while being expressive enough to solve many problems. However it’s rare to see explicit finite state machines in the wild. The first goal of this talk is to convince you to use finite state machines as a tool to model the problems you’re working on, by showing you how they can express tasks such as data validation, web services, and animations.</p>
                    <p>The second goal is to show you how easy it is to use finite state machines. This is partly because the basic model is very simple (we can define it in one line!) but also because finite state machines have a structure that allows for a lot of composition. So we’ll look at monoids, monads, and all our other favourite FP buzzwords, and see how they apply to finite state machines. More importantly, we’ll see how they make finite state machines easier to use and reason about.</p>

                    <p>Our Play web apps’ data science reporting integration was beautiful - it separated concerns in so many elegant ways. Fundamentally, it (re)used some generic code, a Play action function, to instrument each web service endpoint on our edge service (reverse proxy). It kept the data reporting concern decoupled from our business logic, and it performed its work in its own execution context. Not only did it keep developers in the business of building features, but it did not use any threads from Play’s user-facing actor system dispatcher. This was essential for preventing outages: data reporting activities should never interfere with the consumer-facing functionality that powers our business. But there was one major drawback for the data science team: the data was schema-less.</p>
                    <p>Our data team introduced schema requirements, and all hell was breaking loose. We were given schema generation macros that constructed schemas based on data model classes. The data team suggested that our integration points should be moved to our backend services, which was where the data models were defined. They gave us examples where, in their view, we should place the integration points: directly in the code where the business logic was implemented! Not only would this violate our coveted separation of concerns, it could potentially conflate the execution contexts and make the code much harder to reason about and maintain.</p>
                    <p>Back in Java OO-land, circa Two Thousand , it was the Age of Go4 Design Patterns. The company I worked at had solved this type of problem with a Decorator. We used code generation tools to create boilerplate code in decorators that did the heavy lifting for these cross-cutting concerns. Developers could focus on defining interfaces, creating implementations, and writing business logic.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward ahead to today… Enter Scalameta! In this talk, I will describe the approach I took to preserve asynchrony and separation of concerns in our design. The sbt build plugin I created leverages Scalameta to generate type-aware code for each of our endpoints. This code complies beautifully with our schema requirements. A custom Play action function asynchronously invokes it to create a schema-compliant payload that can be shipped off to the data science backend. Along the way I learned some things about Scalameta - it’s really quite beautiful - and struggled through the minefield of building an sbt plugin.</p>
                    <p>This is truly an example of history repeating itself - the tools may be different, but the ideas never die. What’s old is new again!</p>

                    <p>All of us had to learn Scala at some point, and many of us will find ourselves teaching Scala; perhaps to junior developers at our workplace or perhaps at an organisation such as ScalaBridge. In this talk we’ll describe our experiences at ScalaBridge London, where students ranged from those with no prior programming experience to those who held a PhD. We’ll discuss what worked and what didn’t work, and give guidance that applies to anyone who finds themselves teaching or learning Scala.
ScalaBridge London brought together students from underrepresented groups with a shared goal of learning Scala. At the end of our first 12 week course some students secured interviews and even jobs as junior Scala engineers. Although some aspects of ScalaBridge are unique, the majority of what we did applies to anyone learning or teaching Scala.
In this talk we will describe the teaching and mentoring approach we took at ScalaBridge. Students will discuss how the experience shaped their view of the Scala community, how much their knowledge and confidence with Scala grew, and the opportunities that presented themselves because of the course. Mentors will elaborate on teaching methods, mentoring approaches, and potential issues, to help other senior Scala engineers teaching juniors at work or in a course like this.</p>

                    <p>An ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) API and Code Generator for Typeful, Numerically Generic, Functional Deep Learning in Scala</p>
                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <h3>A) API</h3>
                    <p>A complete, versioned, numerically generic, type-safe / typeful API to ONNX(Open Neural Network eXchange, an open format to represent deep learning and classical machine learning models), derived from the Protobuf definitions and the operator schemas (defined in C++) via the JavaCPP Preset for ONNX. We also generate implementations for each operator in terms of core methods to be implemented by the backend.</p>
                    <p>This API is expressed via traits, with version-named methods. For example, Abs, the absolute value operator (defined here for operator set 6):</p>
                    <p>```scala
import scala.{specialized =&gt; sp}
import spire.math.UByte
import spire.math.UShort
import spire.math.UInt
import spire.math.ULong
import spire.math.Numeric
import spire.implicits._
import scala.reflect.ClassTag
import org.emergentorder.onnx._</p>
                    <p>trait Abs extends Operator {
  def Abs6<a>@sp T: Numeric: ClassTag</a>(
        implicit evT: Contains[
          T,
          Union[Float16]#or[Float]#or[Double]#or[UByte]#or[UShort]#or[UInt]#or[ULong]#or[Byte]#or[
            Short
          ]#or[Int]#or[Long]#or[UNil]#create
        ]
    ): (Tensor[T]) //Implementation omitted
}
```</p>
                    <p>A few more examples of the type constraints in action:
<code>scala
val stringTens = TensorFactory.getTensor(Array.fill(3*224*224){"test"},Array(3,224,224))
onnx.Abs6("abs", Some(stringTens))
// error: could not find implicit value for evidence parameter of type spire.math.Numeric[String]
// onnx.Abs6("abs", Some(stringTens))
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></p>
                    <p>
                      <code>scala
val aBigInt = new BigInt(new java.math.BigInteger("5"))
val bigIntTens = TensorFactory.getTensor(Array.fill(3*224*224){aBigInt},Array(3,224,224))
onnx.Abs6("abs", Some(bigIntTens))
// error: Cannot prove that org.emergentorder.onnx.!![scala.math.BigInt] &lt;:&lt; org.emergentorder.onnx.Float16 =&gt; Nothing with Float =&gt; Nothing with Double =&gt; Nothing with spire.math.UByte =&gt; Nothing with spire.math.UShort =&gt; Nothing with spire.math.UInt =&gt; Nothing with spire.math.ULong =&gt; Nothing with Byte =&gt; Nothing with Short =&gt; Nothing with Int =&gt; Nothing with Long =&gt; Nothing with org.emergentorder.onnx.UNil =&gt; Nothing =&gt; Nothing.
// onnx.Abs6("abs", Some(bigIntTens))
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code>
                    </p>
                    <h3>B) Program Generator</h3>
                    <p>Capable of translating ONNX model Protobuf (.onnx) files into Scala programs written in terms of this API.<br>
For example, an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onnx/onnx/master/onnx/backend/test/data/node/test_abs/model.onnx">“absolute value network”</a>:</p>
                    <p>Depending on the size of the ONNX model, you may need to add</p>
                    <p>
                      <code>
export SBT_OPTS="-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Xmx16G -Xss8M -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024M"
</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file or equivalent, or you will encounter errors.</p>
                    <p>Move the model file to <code>programGenerator/.jvm/src/main/resources/absnet.onnx</code>). More models can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/onnx/models">ONNX Model Zoo</a>.</p>
                    <p>
                      <code>
sbt "project programGeneratorJVM" "run absnet.onnx"
</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>The resulting generated program appears as <code>programGenerator/src/gen/scala/Absnet.scala</code>:</p>
                    <p>```scala
import org.emergentorder.onnx.backends._</p>
                    <p>class Absnet(byteArray: Array[Byte]) {
  val Abs: org.emergentorder.onnx.Abs = new NGraphOperatorBackendFull()
  def program(inputDatax: Tensor[Float]): List[Tensor[Float]]  = 
    for {
      nodex &lt;- List(inputDatax)
      nodey &lt;- List(Abs.Abs6(“y” ,X = Some(nodex)))
    } yield (nodey)
}
```</p>
                    <p>and you can run <code>sbt compile</code> to confirm that the generated code compiles.</p>
                    <h3>C) Backend</h3>
                    <p>Currently. at the operator level, a single partial backend implementation of ONNX, accessible from the JVM, is available.</p>
                    <p>This backend is based on <a href="https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph">nGraph</a>, via nGraph JavaCPP Preset.</p>
                    <p>Supported ONNX input and output tensor data types:
* Byte
* Short
* Int
* Long
* Float
* Double</p>
                    <p>Supported ONNX ops:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>All those <a href="https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph/tree/v0.26.0/src/ngraph/frontend/onnx_import/op">supported</a> by nGraph, currently 100 of 153 total. The rest are in the API, but will error if called.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ONNX Runtime, which supports all ONNX ops, is the next targeted backend.</p>
                    <p>You can also pass entire models to nGraph (see Execution Modes below).</p>
                    <p>All together, these should enable model inspection and modification, extra compile-time assurances, mixing/matching of backend operator implementations and integration into JVM-based production systems, for a start.</p>
                    <p>See the full README for more details.</p>
