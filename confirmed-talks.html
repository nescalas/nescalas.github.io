                <p>“Streams” are becoming an increasingly common abstraction in programming languages, and as an example of one we will take a brief dive into FS2 for Scala, a pure functional and generic streaming library, and how it’s applicable to numerous real-world scenarios that you might not initially think of. We will also explore the social issues involved when evangelizing new tech, and why sometimes we can run into fallacious roadblocks where invented complexity prevents us from actually doing the simplest thing. To that end, this talk is about why streaming is simple, generally applicable, similar across languages and libraries, and why you should be using it in more places than ever.</p>

                <p>Our Play web apps’ data science reporting integration was beautiful - it separated concerns in so many elegant ways. Fundamentally, it (re)used some generic code, a Play action function, to instrument each web service endpoint on our edge service (reverse proxy). It kept the data reporting concern decoupled from our business logic, and it performed its work in its own execution context. Not only did it keep developers in the business of building features, but it did not use any threads from Play’s user-facing actor system dispatcher. This was essential for preventing outages: data reporting activities should never interfere with the consumer-facing functionality that powers our business. But there was one major drawback for the data science team: the data was schema-less.</p>
                <p>Our data team introduced schema requirements, and all hell was breaking loose. We were given schema generation macros that constructed schemas based on data model classes. The data team suggested that our integration points should be moved to our backend services, which was where the data models were defined. They gave us examples where, in their view, we should place the integration points: directly in the code where the business logic was implemented! Not only would this violate our coveted separation of concerns, it could potentially conflate the execution contexts and make the code much harder to reason about and maintain.</p>
                <p>Back in Java OO-land, circa Two Thousand , it was the Age of Go4 Design Patterns. The company I worked at had solved this type of problem with a Decorator. We used code generation tools to create boilerplate code in decorators that did the heavy lifting for these cross-cutting concerns. Developers could focus on defining interfaces, creating implementations, and writing business logic.</p>
                <p>Fast forward ahead to today… Enter Scalameta! In this talk, I will describe the approach I took to preserve asynchrony and separation of concerns in our design. The sbt build plugin I created leverages Scalameta to generate type-aware code for each of our endpoints. This code complies beautifully with our schema requirements. A custom Play action function asynchronously invokes it to create a schema-compliant payload that can be shipped off to the data science backend. Along the way I learned some things about Scalameta - it’s really quite beautiful - and struggled through the minefield of building an sbt plugin.</p>
                <p>This is truly an example of history repeating itself - the tools may be different, but the ideas never die. What’s old is new again!</p>

                <p>All of us had to learn Scala at some point, and many of us will find ourselves teaching Scala; perhaps to junior developers at our workplace or perhaps at an organisation such as ScalaBridge. In this talk we’ll describe our experiences at ScalaBridge London, where students ranged from those with no prior programming experience to those who held a PhD. We’ll discuss what worked and what didn’t work, and give guidance that applies to anyone who finds themselves teaching or learning Scala.
		  ScalaBridge London brought together students from underrepresented groups with a shared goal of learning Scala. At the end of our first 12 week course some students secured interviews and even jobs as junior Scala engineers. Although some aspects of ScalaBridge are unique, the majority of what we did applies to anyone learning or teaching Scala.
		  In this talk we will describe the teaching and mentoring approach we took at ScalaBridge. Students will discuss how the experience shaped their view of the Scala community, how much their knowledge and confidence with Scala grew, and the opportunities that presented themselves because of the course. Mentors will elaborate on teaching methods, mentoring approaches, and potential issues, to help other senior Scala engineers teaching juniors at work or in a course like this.</p>

                <p>When I teach Scala, I find that many Scala programmers aren’t familiar with the many kinds of types that Scala’s type system encompasses.

                <h2>Domain Specific means Business Logic</h2>
                <p>In this talk I will make the case for small declarative languages embedded in Scala. We have found the eDSL design pattern can accelerate the writing of business logic while enforcing correctness properties via the Scala typesystem. I will show three examples of eDSLs that solve three different business problems.</p>
                <h3>An eDSL for time-series analytics</h3>
                <p>I will demonstrate an eDSL for elementary statistics and analytics on time-series data. In finance, we often work with periodic arrays of doubles that represent the monthly GDP of a country, quarterly sales margins of a company and more. In order to analyze time-series, some statistics such as arithmetic means, interpolations and Z-scores are necessary. There are plenty of pitfalls where new users can make mistakes, for example taking the standard deviation of an interpolated series will yield a lower volatility that doesn’t correspond to reality. Our eDSL uses Scala types to prohibit incorrect transformations, making the barrier to entry lower and the writing of valuable analytics logic faster.</p>
                <h3>An eDSL for lazily computing on large dataframes</h3>
                <p>Low-level control over timeseries is great, but sometimes we would like more high-level control via dataframes, similar to Pandas or Apache Spark. We would also like these dataframes to maintain the provenance of operations so we can reason about them in a backwards way and find errors. The final eDSL we will show reifies computation via Higher-Order Abstract Syntax (HOAS) and maintains the full provenance without maintaining the results of every intermediate computation step, which can be very expensive.</p>
                <h3>An eDSL for formatting financial reports</h3>
                <p>After generating good financial analytics, we would like to present them in a good looking report. Thankfully, there exist low-level APIs that allow plotting and charting data. Unfortunately, the low-level details such as fonts, colors and axes are intermingled with high-level control over data dimensionality and ordering. We will demonstrate a high-level eDSL that allows one to only care about data and layouting, pushing back formatting to the end, while allowing transparent, compositional access to data throughout the process.</p>
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>There are several approaches to writing embedded DSLs, I would summarize my approach as avoiding unnecessary boilerplate, keeping the category theory knowledge needed at a strict minimum, while leveraging the Scala typesystem and Generalized Algebraic Datatypes (GADTs) as much as possible, to enforce correctness. This approach is motivated by my academic explorations in Formal Verification, where the eDSL semantics must perfectly reflect the language designer’s intention. My goal is to make a convincing case that eDSLs are an effective way to explore the domain of a business problem, while the usage of Scala as the host language is very encouraging, as it allows multiple eDSLs to compose nicely and run on the JVM.</p>

                <p>At the turn of the new year the hashtag #BoringHaskell sparked a debate in the functional programming Twitterverse, drawing into question the overuse of advanced FP techniques at work and how it deters newcomers from the functional paradigm. The Scala community joined in on this discussion, bringing forth its own closet of skeletons and posing some existential questions to itself:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Does functional programming in Scala need a rebrand?</li>
                  <li>Have we gone too far with types and freaky language features?</li>
                  <li>Should we simplify our code for the sake of junior developers?</li>
                  <li>What does simple even mean?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this talk, we aim to settle the debate for Scala programmers based on a hard truth to swallow – functional programming is already simple, but we’ve been implementing it in an unfriendly way.</p>
                <p>First, we look to accurately define what simplicity means in the context of programming. We then introduce a decision framework for Simple Functional Programming centered around three tenets: Composability, Caution and Cleanliness. With these principles in mind, we dive into real world code examples demonstrating effective and confusing deployments of FP. Along the way, we highlight common antipatterns such as completion chasing, type Tetris, and the dreaded Hammer Syndrome.</p>
                <p>The intended audience for this talk includes programmers of all levels. Advanced practitioners will walk away with new strategies for writing approachable code, and less experienced developers will gain new confidence in utilizing functional patterns and libraries. Familiarity with Scala, its syntax and some familiarity with functional programming concepts are assumed, but not required.</p>
